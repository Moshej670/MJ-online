  <h2> notes and reminders </h2>    <HR> 

<P> all notes will be written in this section of the web page instead of in the coding <br>
 <ins> like traditional comments this is for reviewing perposes: </ins>
<p> for img src their are RELETIVE AND DIRECT SOURCES <br>
<em> this is italix basically were is waldo</em><br>
<strong> this is bold can you find me </strong> <br>
 a direct source would be if both files were in the same folder<br>
 and reletive would be when you use a  PATH to get their. this time<br>
 i had to imput all the paths sepratly on all the img sources next time <br>
i hope i can use a link rel for it this reminder was supposed to be a comment<br>
but i changed my mind on it and added it to my weppage for filling. </p>

<aside id="were" > this should be on the left of the webpage and next should be on the write </aside>
<aside id="calabonga"> this should be on  the right of whats on the left which if you press ctrl shift i <br> youll see is called were
and btw this itself is called calabonga which is a weird a** name but its mine too give </aside>
<p> for hyper link images you have to get a picture name it, crop it,<br>
 and in image src write the files name. if you destroy the<br>
 source it vanashes on webpage unless webpage is active<br>
e in my hyposisis make sure to write full name including .png or .jpg<br> </p>
